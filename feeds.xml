            <title>Episode 127 - Simon Pegg, The Human Centipede and swearing</title>
            <description>This week's podcast is short but sweet - much like its host - but don't let that put you off as
                it packs a mighty punch (much like its host if you call him short and sweet). There's a visit from
                friend of the show Simon Pegg who reveals he has a sad habit, we discover a new voice for The X Factor
                and use everyday words as swear words.
                So for flux sake, sit back and enjoy the epping podcast. You complete Jenga!

            <description>Ding Dong Merrily on THIS, podcast lovers…
                Welcome to a very festive edition of the XFM Breakfast Show podcast with Jon Holmes.
                Inside this audible stocking…
                Petrol-heads JEREMY CLARKSON and RICHARD HAMMOND popped by for a chat (we say 'popped by'. They were of
                course in to flog another DVD)
                Matt’s weather gets even more fanciful, and we're treated to another satanical musing (albeit a very
                Christmassy one) from High Priest Vexen Le Crowley.
                So pop another Terry's Chocolate Orange in your fat gob, grab a Bailey's, and enjoy!

            <title>Episode 97 - Christmas Batman, Toddler Pops and Tradesman's Entrance</title>
            <description>As XFM Winter Wonderland took place on Wednesday, we look back at some of the highlights
                including Intern Josh dressed inexplicably as a festive Batman and Producer Dave getting all 'above his
                station' with a walkie-talkie.

                Elsewhere, we hear from another listener in regular feature Tradesman's Entrance. This is where we speak
                to a tradesman who has plied their trade in/or around a celebrity's house. But you knew that already.

                Plus, another round up of the laziest marketing emails of the week in Lazy PR, and 4 year old Maisie
                bangs another tune on Toddler Pops.

            <itunes:summary>As XFM Winter Wonderland took place on Wednesday, we look back at some of the highlights
                including Intern Josh dressed inexplicably as a festive Batman and Producer Dave getting all 'above his
                station' with a walkie-talkie.

                Elsewhere, we hear from another listener in regular feature Tradesman's Entrance. This is where we speak
                to a tradesman who has plied their trade in/or around a celebrity's house. But you knew that already.

            <title>Episode 96 - Harry Hill, Jude Law &amp; Tradesman's Entrance</title>
            <description>As Rebecca Black once said, 'It's Friday, Friday. Got to get down on Friday'.
                Wise words indeed (as long as you're downloading this on the day of release. If not, the sentiment makes
                no sense).
                ANYWAY, we digress. Welcome to the XFM Breakfast Show podcast.
                This week, then…
                HARRY HILL discusses his dogging techniques, JUDE LAW talks naked selfies, and listener Tom reveals all
                about Luisa Zissman's front garden. Not a euphemism.
                Enjoy!

            <title>Episode 89 - Russell Brand, Sad Habits &amp; Tough Mudder</title>
            <description>Well hello there you podcast downloader – isn't this exciting, nearly 90 episodes!! But for
                now, it's Episode 89 – you will hear the following..

                RUSSELL BRAND pops in for a chat, to promote his new book 'Revolution', instead of doing so – he
                discusses the apparent rumour of him running for London Mayor. We round up more of your 'Sad Habits' and
                we talk to another listener who's largely indiscreet about work they've done in or around a celebrity.

                ENJOY, the XFM Breakfast Show Podcast with Jon Holmes: Weekdays 6-10am.

            <title>Episode 88 - Dermot O'Leary, Tradesman's Entrance &amp; Lazy PR!</title>
            <description>Good day to you podcast dweller.

                As luck would have it, you have chanced upon episode 88 (I know, where does the time go?) of The XFM
                Breakfast Show podcast with Jon Holmes. Inside this downloadable treat, Mr Holmes catches up with TV
                presenter DERMOT O’LEARY to chat about naked selfies and public pissing. We also hear from another
                listener in everyone's favourite new feature (for the cheeky name, if nothing else) ‘Tradesman’s
                Entrance’ (this week's covers Elton John and some unfortunate plumbing).
                PLUS, it turns out that Kurt Cobain LOVES Mary Berry! Enjoy.

            <title>Episode 87 - Kevin Bridges, Tradesman's Entrance and Matt's haunted child!</title>
            <description>Hi there, podcast wanderer! Thanks for popping by.

                Welcome to another top notch XFM Breakfast Show Podcast with Jon Holmes.
                Within this audio delight, Jon chats to Scottish comic KEVIN BRIDGES. He swung by to talk about cake
                attacks, prank calls and the importance of the bullet point…it really is much more interesting than it
                may sound from that final highlight.

                Elsewhere, we enjoy another round of 'Tradesman's Entrance', where another listener is largely
                indiscreet about work they've done in or around a celebrity.
                PLUS, newshound Matt Dyson's child (the gift that keeps on giving) continues to see dead people in their
                kitchen. Not creepy at all.

                Enjoy! - The XFM Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes: weekdays 6-10am

            <description>Well, hello there! Welcome to another GROUND-BREAKING* edition of the XFM Breakfast Show
                Podcast With Jon Holmes.
                *Probably not at all ground-breaking
                Within episode 84…
                Your ears will be delighted with the likes of new feature ‘Tradesman’s Entrance’ (it’s Branson-based),
                Matt Dyson becomes an official judge for something very peculiar indeed, PLUS noted broadcast journalist
                John Suchet reads aloud from another celebrity’s laughable autobiography in regular feature (which is
                only on the radio due to it’s incredibly clever name) YO! SUCHET.

                Within episode 84…
                Your ears will be delighted with the likes of new feature ‘Tradesman’s Entrance’ (it’s Branson-based),
                Matt Dyson becomes an official judge for something very peculiar indeed, PLUS noted broadcast journalist
                John Suchet reads aloud from another celebrity’s laughable autobiography in regular feature (which is
                only on the radio due to it’s incredibly clever name) YO! SUCHET.
                Dig in!

                Fireworks.

            <description>Oh hello, us again!
                Congratulations on downloading the best bits of the XFM Breakfast Show, episode 83. You've come a long
                way. Let's get straight to it, shall we?
                Jon chats to Manic Street Preacher NICKY WIRE about service stations (again!), Pringles and his
                anti-social tendencies. Plus, a truly tenuous game of 'Wire or Wire' is played on the actual radio. We
                won't ruin the surprise here as to what this actually entails.

                Also, we launch brand new feature 'Tradesman's Entrance' (it's not what you think, we promise). We also
                sent out Intern Josh to the Apple Store on Regent St for the new release of the iPhone. Armed with a
                megaphone, Jon's twisted instructions and hundreds of sad tech geeks at his disposal, things can only go
                wrong.

            <description>Welcome to another XFM Breakfast Show Podcast, the 82nd one in fact. It’s good to see you
                again!
                As the ‘Princess, the Duchess of the Kate of the Cambridge’ is up the duff, for a second time by the
                mighty seed of William, forging it’s way up the… Ok we’ll leave it there. Moving on, Apple release their
                new 'life-changing' devices such as the Apple Watch, and Jon receives an email with a picture of a penis
                (which we duly pixelate for visual purposes, of course…) weirdly enough from ‘himself’.
                Jon also once again appears on BBC 2’s Newsnight, although this time - disappointingly - it wasn’t about
                his height. ENJOY!

            <title>Episode 81 - Crap grammar, Satanism and Matt Dyson's 'Puck Nips'</title>
            <description>Happy 81st podcast download everyone!
                Well done for getting this far. You have our utmost admiration, as we're sure it can't have been an easy
                ride.
                This week, Vexen Le Crowley celebrates more hellish behaviour in 'Thought For The Day For Satanists', we
                discover why newshound Matt Dyson's nickname used to be 'Puck Nips', and Jon gets angry at some poor
                spelling… and rightly so.
                So sit back and enjoy podcast 81, as we suspect podcast 82 will be arriving in your interweb inbox in
                about a week's time.

            <description>Welcome to another edition of the XFM Breakfast Show Podcast!
                Come on in (but please wipe your feet first. Or take your shoes off altogether. Entirely up to you)
                This week, we chat to boy-wizard turned professional nudist DANIEL RADCLIFFE, and ask him what is sure
                to be one of the more controversial questions he's ever been asked.
                Elsewhere, Jon's now infamous ill-judged fashion sense rears it's ugly head again, we attempt to ruin
                the upcoming campaign for new film 'Sin City 2', and the team rifle through another week's worth of LAZY
                PR.
                Once you've listened, please leave quietly so as to avoid disturbing our local residents.

            <description>Hey there, internet fan! Welcome to The XFM Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes podcast.
                WARNING: This week's edition possibly raises more questions than it answers.
                For instance…
                - Is Jon taller than dead supreme leader Kim Jong-Il?
                - Did Producer Dave really enjoy a naked jacuzzi at his sister's 21st birthday party?
                - Is it possible to blag entry into a gig in Canada by claiming you work for XFM London
                - Does Jon use voice-manipulation equipment to make himself sound taller?
                - What exactly is a 'bender in a bun'?
                For all these weird and wonderful musings, and much more, dig in!

                It’s the wholly unhelpful football fact-filled episode Episode 74 of The XFM Breakfast Show Podcast with
                Jon Holmes. So, what's in this weeks helping?

                To help you through the 'Global Footballing Event 2014' (because, as you know, we can't call it the
                other thing…), we bring you our 'Alternative Guides to the Nations'.
                Elsewhere, we ask you how you'd be bringing the festival experience to your lounge in our #DIYGlasto
                feature, and we spend an inordinate amount of time talking bushes, shafts and softening your wood in the
                'The Largely Irrelevant Paper Review'. 
                Plus, we bid adieu to out little Isle of Wight weirdo Intern Charles, as he performs his last ever task
                in 'Twelve Weeks A Slave' involving builders, sugar and an XFM  branded poncho.
                So, you know, just listen. Cause to be honest, we've run out of clever ways to end these pointless
                blurbs

            <title>Episode 70 - Soft Fruits, KimYe and 1D</title>
            <description>Welcome to the 70th edition of The XFM Breakfast Show Podcast with Jon Holmes. If we were
                married, that'd mean we'd have just gone platinum! How very exciting.
                It may be a short one this week, but it's a bloody good one (no Jon Holmes height jokes necessary).
                This week, we reluctantly learn all about the now newly married power-couple 'KimYe' (which we agree
                sounds more like a Wagamama's side dish), and Matt Dyson informs us of his 'soft fruits' in The Largely
                Irrelevant Paper Review.
                Elsewhere, High Priest Vexen Le Crowley brings us another 'Thought For The Day For Satanists' (a
                festival edition, no less), and XFM's Mystery Sound leaves everybody in the dark, even the team… who
                know the answer.
                So, crack open the bubbly (age dependent on country alcohol laws) and raise a glass to our 70th… CHEERS!

            <description>If this podcast had eyeballs, we'd be up them with the amount of celebs crammed into this
                edition!
                We’ve got Gabby Roslin being all charitable, Courtney Love being all random and Wolverine himself (Hugh
                Jackman), being all brilliant and charming and stuff.

                Elsewhere, we learn about the listeners' most 'flouncy' moments, how many chilli's Intern Charles can
                eat whilst asking questions about his 'homeland' of the Isle of Wight, and just how far can a welly be
                wanged with Weller's face on it? Yep, it's as tenuous as it sounds.

                All this, and probably more. Jump in!

            <title>Episode 68 - Josh Widdicombe takes over</title>
            <description>It’s Episode 68 of the Xfm Breakfast Show Podcast with Jon Holmes, though it’s not Jon at all.
                What the hell is going on?!
                It’s Josh Widdicombe. Him off of XFM's weekend morning show, stand-up comedy and C4's Last Leg fame. Not
                just because we fancied a change, but because Jon is on his holidays.
                This week, we test out newshound Matt Dyson's mixing skills ahead of his debut DJ set, we get your crap
                TV cameos, and what length would you go to for a Blue Peter Badge?
                Also, while Jon’s away the team get to discuss football and Panini Sticker Collections. What a treat!
                Josh is also joined by Aussie comedian Adam Hills.

                Enjoy the podcast as we bring a little bit of the weekend to your weekday, unless this is the weekend
                and you're reading this. In which case ignore the last twenty words.

            <description>Hello there.
                This week The XFM Breakfast Show Podcast with Jon Holmes brings a double header of guests! Not only does
                RICKY GERVAIS return to where it all began for him (XFM, obviously), one half of Peep Show turns up, as
                ROBERT WEBB chats to Jon about butlers, Russell Brand and magic tricks.
                We also tut loudly and shake our heads disapprovingly at more mis-targeted marketing in LAZY PR, and we
                learn a little too much about David Hasselhoff's wiener thanks to much loved midweek feature YO! SUCHET.
                Oh, and we 'rave up' the travel during London's annoying tube strikes. Glow-sticks at the ready, party
                people!

                Oh, and we 'rave up' the travel during London's annoying tube strikes. Glow-sticks at the ready, party
                people!

            <title>Episode 65 - Jon Holmes' Tiny Feet, Matt Dyson battles nature's biggest bullies and Amanda Holden on
                YO! Suchet
            </title>
            <description>The top-line for episode 65 of the XFM Breakfast Show Podcast? Jon Holmes has tiny feet.
                Granted, Jon having small feet possibly isn’t that surprising. Though what he chose to put those feet
                in… is.
                Elsewhere, newshound Matt Dyson takes out his Easter aggression on a helpless washing line, Intern
                Charles sings for Jon’s Birthday in regular feature 12 Weeks A Slave, we find out whether Jon’s dog is
                Dead or Alive, and we ruin/improve Twin Atlantic’s new song for you, depending on whether you also like
                Def Leppard, Whitesnake and One Direction.
                PLUS… breakfast show mainstays YO! Suchet and What The Largely Irrelevant Papers Say.
                We do hope you enjoy it. And if not, well… its not like you paid for it, is it?

            <title>Episode 64 - Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Jon's</title>
            <description>A few rules that have stood the test of time in radio. Be nice to your guests, play games that
                make sense, steers clear of contentious subjects and issues, and don't run a feature just because you've
                thought of a good name for it.
                All advice we've positively eschewed, as we berate Spiderman's Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, play a
                convoluted game of 'Eggs or Benedict', run risky feature 'Twelve Weeks A Slave' and enjoy another round
                of Yo! Suchet. Oh, and there's much discussion over the size of Jon's right nipple.
                Enjoy!

            <description>Welcome to the internet, dear virtual traveller. You've happened upon on an audio podcast. A
                Breakfast show podcast. A podcast that – in essence – is the very best of the worst bits of the XFM
                Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes… without the music. So, if this is your kind of thing, jump in and swim
                around features and competitions and fun and stuff.


                Within the 1's and 0's this week, you will find talk of gigs you didn't mean to go to (though Producer
                Dave definitely wanted to go to Katy B), we learn about much of Jon's childhood from his mum in one-off
                feature 'Uncomfortably Mum', and we say Bon Voyage to the mind that is News Reader Alex. Sob. Enjoy!

            <title>Episode 60 - Kavana, Shed Dancing and Crying</title>
            <description>Hello all! This week, we celebrate The XFM Breakfast Show Podcast's Diamond (60… but you knew
                that) anniversary by having cucumber sandwiches on a plasterers table that we've set up down the middle
                of the office, and then finding any excuse to go to the pub.

                In this very special limited edition episode, we delve into the slightly odd mind of news reader Alex.
                We learn about some of Katie Price's former conquests thanks to John Suchet in regular feature Yo!
                Suchet. Plus, Mr Holmes pitches an audacious proposition to soon-to-be BBC controller Noel Edmonds.

                So, lean back if you're in a chair (but not if you're on a stool or standing up) and enjoy.

            <title>Episode 59 - Reece Shearsmith, Olivia Lee and a few bits we didn't have time for</title>
            <description>SURPRISE! Even whilst Jon Holmes is away, the XFM Breakfast Show podcast shall play. 35 minutes
                of all the best bits that never quite made it into other editions (but trust us, it's still radio gold)
                This highlights package (as it shall now be known), contains two, yes TWO, interviews. The first being
                REECE SHEARMSITH (he of 'League of Gentlemen' fame) and OLIVIA LEE (she of gentlemen's area-based
                microphones fame). We celebrate more 'Lazy PR', plus Vexen Le Crowley offers up another moment of
                clarity and reflection with his 'Thought For The Day For Satanists'.

                So sit down if you need to. Or don't, if you don't... And appreciate the magic of the internet with this
                bumper edition of The XFM Breakfast Show Podcast, even though we have absolutely no idea where the
                presenter is, or what the hell he's doing (probably for the best).

            <title>Episode 58 - Aaron Paul, George Groves and the red carpet</title>
            <description>Ding Ding Ding! It's round 58. And by that we mean it's the 58th podcast in the collection that
                we call The XFM Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes. Why the bad boxing pun? We hear no one mutter. Well,
                it's because we have GEORGE (ST George) GROVES talking about his rematch with Carl Froch. This warrior
                is a soon-to-be sporting legend whom – inexplicably - is a fan of Jon.
                We also have A-list action in the shape of one Mr AARON PAUL (Jesse Pinkman out of off of 'Breaking
                Bad'), talking fast cars, pizza and crystal meth. There's a brief (and slightly disturbing) discussion
                about Jon's member… And now that TV channel BBC Three is on the way out, we look at their programmes
                that didn't exist, but really should have.
                Oh, and Matt's off to have a baby....well his wife is. He'll probably just stand and look on whilst
                eating a Nandos combo meal.

            <description>Another week, another dollar. Actually, it’s another week and another XFM Breakfast Show
                Podcast, ready to occupy you for 40 or so minutes. So, if you’ve got a short commute why not treat it as
                a trilogy? Jon chats to the man who’s playing the man who wrote the James Bond books, actor and all
                round nice beardy bloke DOMINIC COOPER. We have an exclusive chat with a Garvey about a very special
                ELBOW performance, and will the Mystery Object be a roll over once again? Find out inside. Well, when
                you put your headphones inside your ears anyway.

            <description>Assuming our intern has figured out how to upload the damn thing now, you should be enjoying
                all manner of fun and games from The Xfm Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes in the form of a computer
                podcast! I know, groundbreaking stuff.
                In here, you'll find that Producer Dave is proudly one of the biggest moaners within the company (tell
                us something we don't know), Jack Whitehall has just about enough of Jon's constant 'sex jokes' towards
                his various family members, and brand new feature 'Yo! Suchet' kind of works on the radio. Which is
                nice. Enjoy!

            <description>Annoying, needless, and lacking in planning. No, not this week's tube strikes, but THE XFM
                BREAKFAST SHOW PODCAST! (little joke there). This week, Brit acting hero GARY OLDMAN approaches the
                radio platform. Please watch the gap, as Jon also chats to HUGH DENNIS. Mind the closing doors, as we
                discover Producer Dave's house is haunted, and make sure you tap in your oyster card, as Al the Cabbie
                introduces the team to a terrific Beatles-themed invention. We'd give you more information, but we've
                run out of tube-based plays on words… ALL ABOARD!

                more...
            </title>
            <description>This week’s podcast is a bona fide knockout. Joining us on THE XFM BREAKFAST SHOW WITH JON
                HOLMES are Jake LaMotta and Rocky Balboa aka Hollywood heavyweights ROBERT DE NIRO and SYLVESTER
                STALLONE! And to top it off we’ve got the star of Star Trek and new Jack Ryan CHRIS PINE. Ridiculous
                right? But don’t worry, we haven’t gone all superstar on you – in the blue corner we’ve got your
                familiar Thought For The Day For Satanists and in the red corner, just about hanging in there, is
                Producer Dave, reeling from a punch from his past. Matt Dyson takes a new approach to delivering the
                weather, Jon has a satirical bout with UKIP, and there’s a welcome return for the Largely Irrelevant
                Paper Review. The Xfm Breakfast Show will be back every morning next week from 6 til 10 – let’s get
                ready to rumble!

            <description>It’s THE XFM BREAKFAST SHOW WITH JON HOLMES and this week it’s all about comebacks. We’ve got
                the first interview in years with DANNY MCNAMARA who tells us about the hotly anticipated return of
                Embrace. Plus we speak to film star JONAH HILL as he reappears on our screens in The Wolf of Wall
                Street. High Priest Vexen LeCrowley is back with another Thought For The Day For Satanists, and we
                celebrate Producer Dave’s homecoming to his natural habitat – cabaret (seriously). All this as well as
                some spectacular egg-based Chaff News, and Matt Dyson teaches us a new word. The Xfm Breakfast Show is
                back next week, every morning from 6 til 10 – but don’t call it a comeback.

            <title>Episode 50 - New Year, Same Show. With Colin Firth, Dave Rowntree, memories of Leslie Grantham and
                much more...
            </title>
            <description>So, here we are, new year, new show. Well, the same show really. More of the same old rubbish.
                You know you love it. Anyway here it is, THE XFM BREAKFAST SHOW WITH JON HOLMES. And at this optimistic
                time of year full of new resolutions and hopeful opportunity here’s that 99 Problems bit you used to
                know, and that Thought For The Day For Satanists you once loved. But wait, here’s a brand new interview
                with romance’s own COLIN FIRTH, where he sizzles and charms and plays a game of Band or Train. We’re
                also joined by Xfm’s newest DJ, DAVE ROWNTREE from Blur, and we take a look back at Jon’s first ever
                link on the Breakfast Show a year ago. Matt Dyson was away for a few days, nominally ill but presumably
                in Nando’s, until he returned with some classic Chaff News, and there’s a peek at some of the ideas that
                never made it to air over the last year. The Xfm Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes will be back on air
                however every morning next week from 6 til 10. Yes, with more of the same. You’re addicts, the lot of
                you.

                more...
            </title>
            <description>This just in! Stop press – it’s THE XFM BREAKFAST SHOW WITH JON HOLMES! Breaking news this week
                as we were joined by the stars of Anchorman 2, WILL FERRELL and PAUL RUDD. We’ve also got an exclusive
                from Hendon’s Vexen Le Crowley in our regular feature Thought For The Day For Satanists, as well as an
                interview with the best thing about The X Factor – TOM ODELL. And speaking of The X Factor (who’d have
                thought that would be an Xfm topic?) Jon’s got the latest from his favourite
                pop-sensations/mechanically-reclaimed meat-puppets One Direction – unsurprisingly, it doesn’t end well.
                All this plus an editorial insight into life at home with rap’s superstar Jay Zed and internet-botherer
                Beyonce in the return of 99 More Realistic Problems. The Xfm Breakfast Show is back to guide you into

            <itunes:summary>This just in! Stop press – it’s THE XFM BREAKFAST SHOW WITH JON HOLMES! Breaking news this
                week as we were joined by the stars of Anchorman 2, WILL FERRELL and PAUL RUDD. We’ve also got an
                exclusive from Hendon’s Vexen Le Crowley in our regular feature Thought For The Day For Satanists, as
                well as an interview with the best thing about The X Factor – TOM ODELL. And speaking of The X Factor
                (who’d have thought that would be an Xfm topic?) Jon’s got the latest from his favourite
                pop-sensations/mechanically-reclaimed meat-puppets One Direction – unsurprisingly, it doesn’t end well.
                All this plus an editorial insight into life at home with rap’s superstar Jay Zed and internet-botherer

            <title>Episode 47 - Martin Freeman, Harry Hill, ferry advice, a tipsy Jon and much more...</title>
            <description>Arise, and behold the regal XFM BREAKFAST SHOW WITH JON HOLMES. This week one received a visit
                from a cheeky gentleman named HARRY HILL, before becoming acquainted with Hobbity-Prince MARTIN FREEMAN.
                In addition, one's regular Thought For The Day For Satanists was broadcast, and one inaugurated some
                Lazy PR. Gratitude was given to Sir Christopher de Burgh for his travel advice, and a new feature based
                around a mystery guest was coronated! As you will hear, Jon has been working on some impressions, and
                I'm sure you'll agree they're a royal success. Maybe. I think he was in a bit of a fragile mental state
                after Thursday night's Winter Wonderland. That might explain it. Anyway, The Xfm Breakfast Show With Jon
                Holmes will be back with more of the same all next week, on Xfm every weekday from 6am til 10am. Good
                day.

            </title>
            <description>Budge along there, room for a small one, come in, come in. Welcome to THE XFM BREAKFAST SHOW
                WITH JON HOLMES. Lots of pint-sized treats this week; COLIN FARRELL dropped in for a short conversation,
                plus we squeezed a tiny bit of chat out of The Courteeners’ LIAM FRAY. Jon insulted MIRANDA HART before
                she gave us some maracca-based exercise tips and we offered a wee bit of help to the troubled rapper
                Jay-Zed. All this on top of a little visit from Top Gear’s JEREMY CLARKSON and RICHARD HAMMOND – and it
                seems Jon’s developed a bit of a complex…wouldn’t have expected it from the big man. Join us next week
                for more from the Xfm Breakfast Show, everyday from 6am til 10am.

            <description>Storm the gates! Up the revolution! RUSSELL BRAND joins us on THE XFM BREAKFAST SHOW WITH JON
                HOLMES to fight the power by playing a quick round of Band or Kama Sutra Position. We’ve got the
                regime-changing Largely Irrelevant Paper Review plus Comrade Jon really sticks it to the man (Producer
                Dave) after a bust-up over 90s kids show Around The Twist. And whilst the revolution will not be
                televised, our regular Thought For The Day For Satanists will be broadcast right into your ears.
                Homunculus Duff (Brand's words, not ours) Matt Dyson predicted some sports results in the wake of the
                collapse of the football institution, and we heard from our no doubt soon-to-be Head of Culture Tim
                Westwood, in Westwood’s Wise Words of Wisdom. Join us in the New Free World next week for more
                disobedience and protests – Weekdays from 6am, on Xfm.

                communications was undertaken. The Gamemakers hereby present you with an audio edition of the above, for
                responsible predesignated consumption. If deemed acceptable, The XFM Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes will
                return next week at 0600.

            <title>Episode 42 - Jude Law, Steve Coogan, a guest DJ appearance and some intimate mind reading...</title>
            <description>Interviews galore and plenty of zip-bang-crash this week, but the big news is simple – TOBY
                ANSTIS. Heart FM’s very own aardvark aficionado helps out Jon and Producer Dave in spectacular manner,
                dropping by for an extra special guest appearance. Plus decidedly appropriate chats with STEVE COOGAN,
                JUDE LAW and ROSS NOBLE, as well as an inappropriate one with MILES KANE. There’s firework fun and
                Movember tips, alongside the usual Chaff News and Largely Irrelevant Paper Review nonsense. Less usual
                is Jon, Matt and Producer Dave’s diversion into psychic territory – there’s an opportunity to peek
                inside their no doubt troubled, warped and twisted minds, live on air. Which makes a change. As did Matt
                Dyson's unexplained disappearance, which left newsreader Lyndsey to pick up his slack for a few days.
                Tune in next week for more hilarity, though we probably can’t promise any more Anstis. Apologies.

            <title>Episode 41 - David Baddiel, Stephen Merchant and more</title>
            <description>So we’ve finally arrived. Well done. Battling past stormy St Jude was an ordeal, but The XFM
                Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes made it through, as did sciatica-suffering DAVID BADDIEL and the bearded
                STEPHEN MERCHANT. And as if that wasn’t enough, Jon made a startling announcement regarding 80s Scouse
                singing sensation Sonia. Big news indeed. Elsewhere, Producer Dave and Matt Dyson nearly drowned, all
                for the amusement of the spooky ANDY NYMAN. Plus we heard from Mercury Prize winner JAMES BLAKE, who was
                in excruciatingly dull form, and The X-Factor’s Kingsland Road (no, us neither) nailed their flag to The
                XFM Breakfast Show mast. All of this and more in fabulous podcast form, available right here, right now,
                ideal for relieving the boredom next time your journey takes 3 times as long as normal thanks to a
                little bit of wind.

            <description>To those assembled to listen to PODCAST 40, take a pew. We gather here today to pay our
                respects, sing our hymns and to remember he who is no longer here. We are joined by esteemed company -
                the right honourable SIR BEN KINGSLEY is planning a music video about today’s proceedings, and the
                downright dishonourable JAMES CORDEN has just crept back from the lavatories after peeing on his hands.
                JOHN SUCHET will deliver our reading, unconventionally taken from the works of the prophet MORRISSEY,
                and I’m pleased to see you’ve all attended in the traditional garish shirts of late Intern Ger. Yet it
                is not he who we mourn today, but our loyal golden aquatic friend, MR FISH. May he rest in peas.

                but they keep arguing about the night Jack was conceived. Humanoid First Officer Matt Dyson has also
                caused unrest in the ranks by insulting all the Northerners, and it seems that the EARGASM engine needs
                urgent repairs. Our journey has been fraught with danger; the abbreviated horror of SCRAMBY EGGS
                attacked once more, we veered dangerously close to saying something utterly unbroadcastable about
                FLEETWOOD MAC and only just survived the appalling sound effects provided by Intern Ger. I am starting
                to think we may not be alone…

            <title>Episode 36 – Hugh Jackman, Sean Lock, Seann Walsh and Josh Widdicombe</title>
            <description>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways,
                I love you like Podcast 36, as it recaps the past five days.
                I love thee like interviews with WALSH and WIDDICOMBE,
                Or that time we talked about Andy Murray with thumbs up his bum,
                Or when SEAN LOCK’s views on tea were almost obscene,
                Or when HUGH JACKMAN came in, you know, that guy Wolverine,
                Or when another THOUGHT FOR THE DAY verged on SATANIC,
                Or when Dave nearly drowned like he’d survived the Titanic,
                Or when Eddie Temple-Morris went into Dragon’s Den,
                Or when WESTWOOD spoke on philosophy and found inner Zen,
                Or when MATT’S NOSTRIL HAIRS led to worrying groans,
                I love you like the XFM Breakfast Show, with presenter Jon Holmes.

                About ten ways then, just listen.

            <title>Episode 35 – Adam Hills, Kodaline and Irish Japery</title>
            <description>One Man. One Newsreader. Two producers and various other contributors. Listen to what critics
                have described as “Podcast 35”, a high-octane, thrilling highlights package of relatively modest
                proportions. Be astounded as Australian funny-man ADAM HILLS explains the mathematical formula for
                comedy, be shocked as KODALINE argue about Irish tourist destinations, and be confused as Matt Dyson
                falls off a Segway. Plus terrible sound effects, THOUGHT FOR THE DAY FOR SATANISTS, a mystery
                Northampton clown and Producer Dave’s Irish accent. Apologies in advance, refunds not available.

                questions about pandas, Jon broke numerous workplace rules by forcing Intern Ger to tattoo his derrière
                and we hear how BEZ from the Happy Mondays has bees in his breeches. Plus the emotional finale to MILES

            <description>Hello dearest internet traveller. Good to see you again. Nice shoes.
                Buried deep within this edition of the Xfm Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes Podcast, you will find Jon
                impersonating Dick Van Dyke and Andy Parsons simultaneously, another terrific 'Thought For The Day For
                Satanists', the team being a little bit slanderous, and 'Miles Away' with Miles Hunt out of off of The
                Wonder Stuff.
                Oh, and there's a bit of bonus 'Choice FM' material, weirdly.

            <title>Episode 29 - Frank Turner, Dyson naked on Ebay and Absolute Belters</title>
            <description>WARNING: Podcast 29 contains audio nudity. After Jon sketches Matt in a seductive pose, we put
                the offending image up for auction with ludicrous results. Jon chats to FRANK TURNER, making him play a
                game that’s so tenuous he’s driven to drink. We hear how Ian Camfield’s adult phone line continues to do
                roaring business and how Producer Dave’s “absolute belters” are ruining Xfm. PLUS a bag of Chaff news

            <description>Hello! Welcome to Podcast 21 of 21 for The Xfm Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes. What craziness
                can you expect this week…?
                WILL AND JADEN SMITH chat to Jon about Bieber, cricket, and terrible parenting. Everyone's favourite
                scouser (behind Joey Barton) MILES KANE charms the socks off the Breakfast team and chats bacon sarnies.
                Jon turns up a tad late to his own breakfast show, and 'every nipple helps'… Apparently.
                Enjoy!

            <description>Within PODCAST 20 (aside from the rather long and very weird introduction), Jon chats to BILL
                BAILEY about Slipknot, weird comedy awards and sheds. Stars of the Hangover BRADLEY COOPER and ED HELMS
                join Jon for another stupid game and chat about hiking, Producer Dave goes into WAY too much detail over
                Shakira's breasts, and sticking with breasts, we reveal how MYLEENE KLASS has been letting everyone have
                a go on hers! It's not as weird as it sounds. Oh no wait, yes it is.

            <itunes:summary>The 5th Podcast has arrived, and oh we have some treats for you. BIFFY CLYRO play Popstars
                Win Prizes, although they aren’t popstars and actually, there are no prizes! PAUL RUDD expresses his
                love for XFM, sincerely. We spice up the UK’s football club names and we discuss some Lazy PR. Oh, and
                Chris Martin popped down to our under resourced studio to give a, well, different rendition of ‘Fix
                You’. Dive in…

            <title>Episode 4 - Denzel Washington, Kelly Jones, Lazy PR</title>
            <description>As another week comes screeching to a halt on The Xfm Breakfast Show with Jon Holmes, another
                Podcast can now be tentatively released into the iTunes wild! But be careful, it bites!
                Episode 4 sees DENZEL WASHINGTON play a silly game…and KELLY JONES answer some rather ridiculous
                questions in 'Popstars Win Prizes'. Elsewhere, a bear attacks BBC 5 Live's studio, a rival radio
                presenter unashamedly slags off our very own Matt Dyson, and the listeners get creative with film
                prequels that never did – but should have – existed. JUMP IN!

            <title>Episode 3 - Arnold Schwarzenegger, Denzel Washington and Frank Turner.</title>
            <description>It's now a trilogy! Who'd have thought it. Rest assured though, it's much better than the third
                installment of The Godfather…
                Jon tries his very best to interview ARNOLD SCHWARZENGGER, but it doesn't quite go to plan…
                For a more successful A-list chat, Jon then turns his attentions to DENZEL WASHINGTON! He even plays a
                little game for us.
                FRANK TURNER plays 'Popstars Win Prizes' – Jon's brand new game that isn't for popstars and doesn't
                actually have any prizes…
                PLUS, we're joined by Florence and her Machine in Xfm's Under-Resourced Studio! She actually brought the
                machine with her on this occasion!
                DELVE IN!
